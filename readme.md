# MHVAA-GCN: Multi-Head Variable Asynchronous Attention Graph Convolutional Network
This repository contains the implementation of MHVAA-GCN, a graph neural network designed to capture both synchronous and asynchronous correlations in multivariate time series data for fault diagnosis tasks. The model includes a learnable time offset matrix, a multi-head asynchronous attention mechanism, and dynamic graph convolution layers, making it adaptable to complex systems like HVAC, power systems, and industrial processes. The provided code and datasets allow users to train, test, and adapt the model for their applications.
